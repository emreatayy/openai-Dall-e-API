hi

(node.js version 18 and higher is required)

Get your API key here: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

After getting the APIkey, write it in the code(7th line)

Run cmd from where you downloaded the code, like this(C:\Users\ynsem\Downloads>)

And then write this code in cmd and run
    --> node generate.js

If you don't get an error, your image will be created in the code folder.

i want to generate other images you can change the 14th line of code
